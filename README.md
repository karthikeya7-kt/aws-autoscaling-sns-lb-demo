# aws-autoscaling-sns-lb-demo
This project uses EC2, a custom AMI, Load Balancer, and an Auto Scaling Group monitored through CloudWatch. When CPU crosses thresholds, CloudWatch triggers an SNS email alert. It demonstrates automated monitoring, scaling, and alerting using AWS Free Tier, showing how instances launch reliably from a AMI and distribute traffic efficiently.
