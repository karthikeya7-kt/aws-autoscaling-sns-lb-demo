1. Launch EC2 Instance

Launched a t2.micro instance (Free Tier).

Installed webserver / configured environment.

Verified it runs properly.

2. Create AMI

Created an AMI from the EC2 instance to preserve configuration.

AMI is used as the base image for scaling.

3. Create Launch Template

Used the AMI as the template image.

Configured instance type, security group, user data if needed.

4. Create Target Group

Target type: Instances.

Health check: HTTP on port 80.

Will attach EC2 instances created by ASG.

5. Create Application Load Balancer (ALB)

Chose Application Load Balancer.

Attached the Target Group.

ALB distributes traffic across instances.

6. Create Auto Scaling Group (ASG)

Connected ASG to Launch Template + Target Group.

Set capacity: min = 1, desired = 1, max = 2.

ASG automatically launches new instances when CPU is high.

7. Create CloudWatch Alarm

Metric: CPUUtilization of ASG instances.

Threshold example: > 70% for 2 minutes.

Action: Trigger SNS notification.

8. Create SNS Topic

Created an SNS Email Topic.

Subscribed using email → confirmed subscription.

CloudWatch alarm triggers this SNS topic.

9. Trigger Scaling

Used stress or CPU load to increase usage.

Observed CloudWatch spike, ASG launching new instance.

Received SNS email alert.

10. Test & Cleanup

Tested ALB DNS, observed traffic distribution.

Deleted AMI, snapshots, ASG, ALB after testing.
